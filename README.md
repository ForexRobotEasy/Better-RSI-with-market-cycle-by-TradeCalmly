# Better RSI.mq5

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 that combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Market Cycle indicators to generate trading signals. It is based on the 'Better RSI' indicator developed by TradeCalmly.

## Functionality

The indicator calculates the RSI and Market Cycle values based on the specified input parameters. It then stores these values in buffer arrays for further analysis. The RSI and Market Cycle values are used to generate trading signals.

### Inputs

- RSI_Period: The period length for calculating the RSI. Default value is 14.
- RSI_Method: The smoothing method for the RSI. Default value is Simple Moving Average (MODE_SMA).
- RSI_Threshold: The overbought/oversold threshold for the RSI. Default value is 70.

- Market_Cycle_Period: The period length for calculating the Market Cycle. Default value is 10.
- Market_Cycle_Method: The smoothing method for the Market Cycle. Default value is Simple Moving Average (MODE_SMA).

### Initialization

In the initialization function `OnInit()`, the indicator buffers are mapped and initialized with empty values. The indicator labels are also set.

### Tick Function

In the tick function `OnTick()`, the RSI and Market Cycle values are calculated using the `iRSI()` and `iMA()` functions respectively. These values are then stored in the buffer arrays.

Trading signals are generated based on the RSI and Market Cycle values. If the RSI is below the overbought/oversold threshold and the Market Cycle is positive, a bullish signal is generated (Buy). If the RSI is above (100 - RSI_Threshold) and the Market Cycle is negative, a bearish signal is generated (Sell).

The trading signals are displayed using the `Print()` function.

### Deinitialization

In the deinitialization function `OnDeinit()`, the indicator buffers are freed.
